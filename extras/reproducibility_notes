----------
The md5 checksum hashes were obtained by using the following python setup

export PATH="/net2/nnz/opt/miniconda/bin:$PATH"; export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE ; . activate platforms

The tests were run on gfdl-ws , gfdl-pan-* using the same python executable and environment as shown above!

There seems  to be at least two sets of different answers for two sets of platforms:
- Checksums match between gfdl-ws , gfdl-pan-202 , awscloud, 
- Checksums match between gfdl-pan-10* , gfdl amdbox
